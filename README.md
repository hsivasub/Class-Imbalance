# Class-Imbalance
This project tells how to deal with a data having class imbalance. 
Here methods of re sampling like up sampling and down sampling were performed and compared. 
Random Forest Classifier was used to predict the test results and hyper-parameters were chosen based on maximum test accuracy.
The model with lowest balance error rate was finally chosen to predict the unknown test data.
